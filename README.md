Cultiva is an **offline-first desktop habit tracker** built around a simple idea: habits don’t get checked off — they **grow**. Each habit you plant evolves from a seed into something lasting, reflecting the time and consistency you put into it.

**No subscriptions. No cloud. No noise.** Just you and your garden.

|--------|----------|
| **Installer** (`.exe`) | Daily use — shortcuts, uninstall entry, in-app updates when published on GitHub Releases |
| **Portable** (`.exe`) | USB or “no install” workflows |

> First launch may take a moment while local storage (IndexedDB) initializes.

## How it works

Plant a habit. Show up. Watch it grow.

```
Seed → Sprout → Plant → Tree → Legacy (365+ days)
```

Each stage is a **visual milestone**, not just a counter. After **365 days**, the habit becomes a **Legacy** tree — a permanent trophy in your garden.
